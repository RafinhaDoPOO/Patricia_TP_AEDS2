Abstract
Monitoring the weight of beef cattle is extremely important for rural producers. This proposal aims to automatically predict animal weight with an emphasis on extracting information from images using computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In contrast to the conventional method with mechanical scales, this new approach proposes generating a dataset containing images of cattle, which are then used to train a U-NET model capable of performing animal segmentation. Subsequently, relevant attributes are extracted, and machine learning models are trained to predict the cattle's weight. The approach was implemented in Python and executed on Google Colab and Google Cloud Virtual Machines platforms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12.83kg.
