Abstract
Participatory Sensing Networks (PSNs) are systems where data-contributing nodes are individuals with mobile devices. These systems often struggle with a lack of user engagement. myMobiConf is an example of an event-support PSN that uses a gamification approach to try and mitigate this disengagement. Observing successful PSNs like the social media platform Instagram, and the strong presence of sticker albums in Brazilian culture, this work proposes implementing a sticker album integrated with Instagram as an addition to the application's gamification strategy. The implementation of the sticker album during events proved effective in increasing participant engagement, leading to more frequent returns to the application throughout the event.
