Abstract
Currently, various GPS (Global Positioning System) technologies are available for location solutions across different application fields. However, the accuracy of these technologies can vary significantly, especially inside buildings where numerous satellite signal blockages may occur. Alternative approaches for such scenarios that yield good results often rely on additional infrastructure to improve precision.
In contrast, the approach presented in this work uses only the integrated components of smartphones to provide a viable navigation system for an event participation application called myMobiConf. The implemented proposal proved efficient for a wide range of buildings and, consequently, various types of events. It also utilizes sensor fusion to compensate for the inherent errors of inertial navigation systems.
