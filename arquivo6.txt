Abstract
This article presents a Web system that simulates a Virtual Plenary to compare the political ideologies of candidates for municipal legislative positions. The goal is to provide an interactive platform where users can participate in a virtual plenary session and, at the end, compare their choices on proposed bills with those of elected council members. This comparison between user choices and council members' choices provides a comparative evaluation of their political ideology. The system features a user-friendly interface, mechanisms for data collection and processing, and utilizes the PCA algorithm in constructing the comparative analysis. The system's effectiveness and usability were assessed through tests conducted with real users.
